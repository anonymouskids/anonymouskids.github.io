> Fig. 1: The bias distribution on MIT intrinsic dataset and our MIID dataset.

From the figure above, we can see that the biases between the reflectance image and the input image follow a heavy-tailed distribution with zero mean, which validate our assumption that the reflectance image has small deviation from the input image.

> Fig. 7: Visual results of our algorithm on newly captured dataset. Noted that we use 2 different spectral imagers, so there may be a little color difference caused by different white balance methods.

## <span id='contri'>Contribution</span>
In sum, our LRIID algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on MIID problem. And our MIID dataset with the ground truth would play an important role in MIID problems.
